description: Create a new git branch with a descriptive name based on current changes
---

1. Analyze current changes and task context to determine a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feat/add-login-ui` or `fix/navigation-bug`).

2. Create and switch to the new branch
// turbo
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```
